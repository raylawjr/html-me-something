                <h2>Oklahoma City, OK
                </h2>
                <p>I was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on October 21st, 1983.  I don't really remember much of anything about Oklahoma City because my family moved away when I was 3 years old.  However, my paternal grandparents also lived in Oklahoma City so we did come back to visit from time to time.  My maternal grandparents lived relatively nearby in Tulsa, Oklahoma (and still live there today!).

                </h2>
                <p>As I mentioned in the last section, my family moved from Oklahoma when I was 3 years old to Fenton, MO.  My father had gotten a job for the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod in Kirkwood, MO.  We initially went to church and school at St. Paul's Lutheran in Des Peres, but switched to nearby Our Savior Lutheran when I was in the 1st grade.  We lived in Fenton until I was 12 years old, when we moved again.  I have a lot of golden childhood memories from Fenton, it has changed a lot since we moved away...

                </h2>
                <p>My family moved to Barnhart when I was in the 6th grade.  My parents still live in Barnhart, and it is the town I probably still consider "home" today.  Although I lived in Barnhart, I didn't go to any local schools.  I still finished junior high at Our Savior Lutheran in Fenton and then attended high school at Lutheran High School South in Affton, MO.    I also initially made friends with some of the new neighborhood kids, but my closest neighborhood friends moved away after a year or so and I didn't really socialize with anyone else in the neighborhood.  I did, however, make some great friends when I started working at Target in Arnold, MO during High School.

                <h2>Edwardsville, IL
                </h2>
                <p>I moved to Edwardsville, IL to go to college at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville.  I really enjoyed going to school here, although I wish I had majored in something with more promising career prospects than Speech Communication.  In my defense, I studied that major because I thought the skills would be useful in practice as an attorney, and it didn't really matter what your Bachelor's degree was in order to get into law school.  I made some good friends and met my wife at SIUE.  Like Fenton, Edwardsville is a town that changed quite a bit soon after I moved away.

                </h2>
                <p>After college, I briefly moved back with my parents in Barnhart for the summer before moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma for law school at Tulsa University.  TU is a really nice school with a great campus smack in the middle of a pretty rough area of Tulsa.  Like undergrad, I lived on campus.  I have lots of family living in Tulsa, however I didn't really get much time to see them while I lived here because I was really busy with my studies.  I spent most of my time at the Law building or in my apartment.

                <h2>Carbondale, IL
                </h2>
                <p>I really liked the TU law school faculty and my peers, however I transferred to SIU Carbondale Law School so that I would be closer to my girlfriend.  In hindsight, this was probably not a very good decision career wise because I did not like Carbondale at all.  I had a few friends there already, but my fellow students were not very friendly, neither was the faculty.  I dropped out of law school after finishing my first semester there.  I am, however, happily married to that girl and I'm not sure if our relationship would have survived if I had stayed in Tulsa for 2 more years.

                </h2>
                <p>After I left law school in Carbondale, I moved in with my girlfriend in Granite City, IL. She worked nearby across the river in Hazelwood, MO at the time as a high school Chemistry teacher.  This was right when the economy was tanking in 2008, so with my already fairly unmarketable Speech Communication degree, I had a hard time finding a job.  I ended up working at my dad's law office as an office assistant.  My girlfriend and I got married in May, and she had taken a teaching job in DeSoto MO so I moved again to be closer to her new job.

                </h2>
                <p>My wife and I moved to Herculaneum after we got married in 2008.  With bleak career prospects, I went back to law school in Carbondale that summer but I was really unhappy with the idea of being a lawyer at that point so I once again left early into the Fall semester.  I went back to SIU in Edwardsville and earned my Art Education Certification, commuting from our house in Herculaneum.  I managed to get a teaching job in Potosi, MO as a middle school art teacher.  I like where we live now.  Both of my children have been born while living in this house.  When I finish LC101 and (hopefully) get a coding job, we will be looking to move again... If any of my kids make a webpage like this, Herculaneum would be their first section!
